Header inspired in medium
============================

![alt text](/images/medium_header.jpg)

One website I usually visit is medium.com. One thing I was fascinated about medium is their articles header. I tried to find out similar code on the internet, but I didn't find it. For this reason, I decide to make my own code and release it under MIT license. 

### Features.

- Responsibe design made using HTML5 + CSS3.
- Header image blurred when you scroll down.
- Text gravity: dissapears and moves when you scroll down.

### Future improvements.

One cool thing I'll implement in the future is the creation of automatic blurred images. In the current version, you'll need to process or upload a blurred image in order to works as expected. 

If you're a developer, feel free to use my code. And if you have some ideas and feedback, please, open an issue or write me an email: <dividirporcero@gmail.com>. Would be awesome to hear your ideas ;).

Cheers!.
Jorge.
